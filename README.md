# John Driscoll

Hi, I’m John 👋 — a data scientist and human–AI interaction researcher focused on **child & family safety**, **usable privacy**, and **decision support for vulnerable users**.

I’m currently a **Data Science M.S. student at UC San Diego** where I design and evaluate systems that help families, students, and communities interact with AI and data safely and effectively.

## 🔍 Research interests

- **Child & family safety in human–AI interaction**  
  Parental controls, child-safe LLMs, and transparency/logging tools for families.

- **Usable privacy, AI safety, and governance**  
  Turning people’s mental models of risk into concrete controls, interfaces, and policy-facing evaluation methods.

- **Learning, metacognition, and visualization**  
  Tools that help students reflect, track progress, and make better decisions; interfaces as experiments on human judgment.

## 🧪 Selected projects

### Human–AI interaction, privacy, and safety

- **Family-Safe GenAI & Parental Controls**  
  *Mixed-methods study + prototype*  
  - Interviewed parents of K–12 students about how their kids use GenAI chatbots and what they want to moderate.  
  - Built LLM-backed prototypes with controls over topics, tone, and when the model defers to an adult, plus visualization of children’s usage.  
  - Prototypes built on top of open-source UIs such as  
  - Code: private; available on request where appropriate.

- **Compass-X – Metacognition Tool for CS2**  
  *Web app + large-scale deployment*  
  - Full-stack tool that prompts students to reflect on their study plans and progress in data structures courses.  
  - Deployed in a large CS2 course; used logs + grades + surveys to study relationships between usage, learning outcomes, and confidence.  
  - Code: private; available on request where appropriate.
